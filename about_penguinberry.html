            <h1>What is a Penguinberry?</h1>
            <p>You may think that a Penguinberry is a penguin-shaped berry, but alas it is not <i>(although it could be)</i>. 
               My favorite video game series of all time is Final Fantasy and one of the most infamous monsters you can face in it is called a "Tonberry".
               Over the past couple of years, I have been wanting to build my own social media handle and start streaming my favorite games. I decided that my
               username would be a combination of one of my favorite animals and video game enemies, hence "Penguinberry" was born.
            </p>
            <p> 
               My goal is to graduate from college with a degree in multimedia and use what I have learned to help with my streaming platform business as well as 
               provide similar services to others. In 2024, I plan on getting my stream and merchandise store set up!
